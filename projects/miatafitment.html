          <p>
            The summer of 2024 was the first summer I spent out in Pullman, if
            anyone happens to read this and doesn't know Pullman, Pullman is a
            college town, so when the spring semester ends, the city empties
            out. Outside of my internship at SEL, I didn't really have anything
            to do, so I'd spent a lot of time that summer doom scrolling forums
            relating to Mazda Miatas.
          </p>
          <p>
            I saw a question being asked over and over again in many different
            ways, all relating to how different wheel specs fit on a Miata. I
            knew this was a big topic because I've also spent dozens of hours
            researching this for my personal Miata. At the time I was playing
            around with ThreeJS, which is a general purpose, lightweight, easy
            to use 3D JavaScript library.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, being the car guy that I am, I was modeling cars in 3D
            when I realized that you can actually model cars to scale, and once
            you figured out the scale, you could model any wheel, tire, or
            suspension setup for any car.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this was a problem that I could solve, I could really make an
            impact on a community that I care so much about.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I grabbed a 3D Miata scan off the internet, loaded it up in
            Blender, and got to work. It was my first time ever using Blender,
            so I had to teach myself the basics. Once I got comfortable, I
            textured the model and scaled it using the stock 14” wheel as
            reference.
          </p>
          <p>
            My Blender skills were (and still are) questionable, but the first
            draft looked something like this:
          </p>
          <img src="mf1.png" alt="freeway game" class="project-gif" />
          <p>
            The model definitely needed some cleanup. The UI looked fine on
            desktop, but the sidebar took up the entire screen on mobile, which
            made it basically unusable. It was also missing features like wheel
            spacer support and other Miata generations (NB, NC, ND).
          </p>
          <p>
            But even in that state, it solved a real problem. And I was
            genuinely surprised by how supportive the community was.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the rest of 2024 and some of 2025 I made some improvements, but
            I was mostly busy with other things, like my internship, school, and
            climbing.
          </p>
          <p>
            During that time I noticed the traction the website received, after
            talking to some people I realized I might have something on my
            hands, so I entered it in the 2025 WSU Business Plan Competition.
          </p>
          <img src="mf2.png" alt="freeway game" class="project-gif" />
          <p>
            During the time leading up to competition, I put a lot of work into
            prettying up the site, adding features, and most importantly,
            getting user feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time of entering Miata Fitment in the competition it was used
            by about 900 people. Those 900 people came from 47 different
            countries, and 13% of people came to the site more than once.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember a particular Redditor mentioned "If you make this a
            complete website with all models and other stuff, the community is
            going to love you"
          </p>
          <img src="mf3.png" alt="freeway game" class="project-gif" />
          <p>
            I ended up placing 5th, which won me $2,000 to invest into the
            site... which I promptly spent backpacking Europe that same summer.
          </p>
          <p>
            But more importantly, it made me realize I might actually have
            something here. So I doubled down, took the community’s feedback
            seriously, cleaned up a lot of tech debt, redesigned the UI (again),
            added more generations, and built features like suspension
            simulation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, miatafitment.com has been used by around 3,000 people and
            generates some money through merch sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past few months, I’ve been paying closer attention to
            monetization. Roughly 10% of users click through to look at wheels.
            Right now that routes to someone else’s site but if that were an
            affiliate link (or my own inventory), there’s clearly potential
            there.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m still figuring that piece out. But for now, I’m just proud I was
            able to solve a real problem for the community.
          </p>

          <p>
            I plan to enter the 2026 competition and focus more seriously on
            monetization. The goal is to turn this into a legitimate side
            business with the goal of maybe being able to justify spending even
            more money on car parts :)
