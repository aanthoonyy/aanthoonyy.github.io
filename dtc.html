        1. How do you define "inclusion?" What does it mean for an environment
        to be inclusive?
      </h3>
      <p>
        To me inclusion means a space were people of all groups and backgrounds
        have access to the same opportunites and resources. For an environment
        to be able to provide that space, it must have values rooted in
        respecting differences that people might have from another person.
        Provide the same opportunites to all people, and support all people in
        whatever they want from their own life. Everyone should feel safe from
        bullying and harassment, and everyone should have an opportunity learn
        about other peoples views to better understand each other.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What do you think are the particular benefits of online environments for
        inclusion?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think the particular benefits of online environments for inclusion is
        that it allows you to connect with people who aren't normally people you
        can connect with. I think about how movements can spread so fast over
        social media or how there are niche communties of people that you can
        meet from all over the world. I like cars, and I've been fixing up my
        Mazda Miata over the last couple years, and the online Miata community
        allowed me to get rare parts, help diagnose, and even make some friends
        in the greater PNW. And I know there are a lot of communities for a lot
        of different things someone could be into.

      <h3>
        What do you think are the particular challenges in online environments
        for inclusion?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think the particular challenegs in online environments for inclusion
        is that there is a little bit of anonymity. Which can be a good thing
        maybe, but it can allow for people to harass and bully people without
        reprocussions in their real lives. Another thing that can be seen as a
        negative could be issues with censorship, I think a some countries don't
        have free access to the internet, which could suppress groups of people.

        This week's assignment it was my goal to make my personal website way
        more accessible, and it was quite the eye-opener! I started off by
        diving into the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool, which is a tool
        developed by WebAIM. It looks through your site and tells you where your
        website lacks on accessibility. Following its advice, I went ahead and
        added alt text to all my images, tweaked headers to organize my content
        better, and added up the contrast on my text to make it easier on the
        eyes. It was all about making sure anyone and everyone could get the
        gist of my site, no matter what kind of obstacles they might be facing.
        These principles on universal design are all focused about making stuff
        usable for as many people as possible. By adding alt text, I was
        applying the "Equitable Use" principle, making sure users who rely on
        text to speech aren't left out. The headers were my way of keeping
        things clear and organized, crossing off the "Perceptible Information"
        rule. And with the boosted text contrast, I was applying the "Low
        physical Effort" rule, making sure everyone could read my site without
        squinting or straining. Reflecting on this assignment made me see my
        website in a whole new light. It wasn't just about displaying my
        projects, and information about me. It was about taking pride in
        something and making it so anyone can enjoy my stuff. It reminds me that
        I have to update this website to have my most recent internship where I
        work as a front end web developer. But also it serves a reminder that at
        my internship, I should strive to make sure our web applications work
        for all users!
