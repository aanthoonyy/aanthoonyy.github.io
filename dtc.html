        <h3>1. How do you define "inclusion?" What does it mean for an environment to be inclusive?</h3>
        <p>To me inclusion means a space were people of all groups and backgrounds have access to the same opportunites and resources.
            For an environment to be able to provide that space, it must have values rooted in respecting differences that people
            might have from another person. Provide the same opportunites to all people, and support all people in whatever they
            want from their own life. Everyone should feel safe from bullying and harassment, and everyone should have an opportunity
            learn about other peoples views to better understand each other.
        </p>
        <h3>What do you think are the particular benefits of online environments for inclusion?</h3>
        <p>I think the particular benefits of online environments for inclusion is that it allows you to connect with people who
            aren't normally people you can connect with. I think about how movements can spread so fast over social media or how
            there are niche communties of people that you can meet from all over the world. I like cars, and I've been fixing up
            my Mazda Miata over the last couple years, and the online Miata community allowed me to get rare parts, help diagnose,
            and even make some friends in the greater PNW. And I know there are a lot of communities for a lot of different things
            someone could be into.
        </p>
        <h3>What do you think are the particular challenges in online environments for inclusion?</h3>
        <p>I think the particular challenegs in online environments for inclusion is that there is a little bit of anonymity.
            Which can be a good thing maybe, but it can allow for people to harass and bully people without reprocussions in
            their real lives. Another thing that can be seen as a negative could be issues with censorship, I think a some
            countries don't have free access to the internet, which could suppress groups of people.
